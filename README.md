m-file description:
  
  PWE_JDQR.m is an example m-file that illustrates the use of the JDQR algorithm.
  jdqr.m is my implementation of the JDQR algorithm for HERMITIAN matrices. Do not use in non-Hermitian eigen-problems.
  MV.m describes the action of the eigen-matrix on a vector
  dielectric_tensors.m calculates the dielectric tensors required for averaging
  lattice_vectors_rect.m calculates the reciprocal lattice vectors.
  dielectric_averaging2.m performs dielectric averaging.
  mymgs.m performs modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.
  orth_vecs.m calculates the orthogonal eigenvectors used in the magnetic field expansion.
